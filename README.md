### Bio
Hello, I am Miles. Currently, I am enrolled at Southwest Tech in their Software Development program. I hope to gain the skills necessary to become an a fantastic programmer. Or as my mom would say, "a massive nerd." Thus far, I can say, my "nerdiness" has leveled up since starting this program. I hope to be able to work on important projects now and in the future.

### Projects
This repository is meant to hold and showcase projects that are hopefully appealing to any employers out there. If that is you and what I got looks good, let me know.


Currently no projects to be shown.
